Minimum Best Security Practices
    Secure Coding Practices: All contributors must adhere to secure coding practices to prevent common security issues like code injection, path traversal, etc. This may involve using secure libraries, proper input validation, etc. You can refer to resources like the OWASP Top 10 for more information on secure coding practices.

    Least Privilege Principle: Every module (such as a service, function, etc.) should operate with the least amount of privilege necessary to complete its function, reducing the potential damage from a breach.

    Data Protection: All data stored and processed should be protected according to its sensitivity. This may involve encryption of sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.

    Authentication and Authorization: All accesses should be authenticated and authorized. This includes both user access and programmatic access (like API access).

    Logging and Monitoring: All activities should be logged and monitored for potential security incidents.

    Dependency Management: All dependencies should be kept up to date, and their security should be assessed regularly.

    Incident Response: There should be a process in place for responding to security incidents.

    Security Testing: Regular security testing (like penetration testing) should be conducted to find and fix security issues.

    Code Review: All code should be reviewed by at least one other person before being merged to the main branch. This can help catch potential security issues.

    Infrastructure Security: In a Kubernetes project, this includes practices like limiting access to the Kubernetes API, using network policies to limit traffic between pods, and keeping the Kubernetes version up to date.
