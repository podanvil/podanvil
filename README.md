Roadmap

    Code Development: Begin working on the code for your project. This might involve writing Python scripts to interact with Kubernetes, developing your application's logic, setting up your deployment pipelines, and so forth.

    Documentation: As you develop your code, remember to document your functions, classes, methods, and modules. This will make your code easier to understand and maintain. Also, consider creating a user guide or manual in your repository to help users understand how to use your software.

    Testing: Write tests for your code to ensure it works as expected. This could include unit tests for individual functions or methods, integration tests to ensure different parts of your application work together, and end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions.

    Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): You might want to set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of testing your code and deploying your application. There are many CI/CD tools available, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions.

    Community Engagement: Engage with your project's community. Respond to issues that users open, review pull requests, update your project's documentation based on user feedback, and so forth. Building a strong community can help your project grow and improve.
