<p>Picking the right video codec can make a big difference in your video&#8217;s quality and the time it takes to record. Let&#8217;s look at three important ones: NVENC, x264, and AV1.</p>



<p>NVENC is great for recording high-quality videos quickly. It uses the power of Nvidia GPUs, freeing up your computer&#8217;s main processor.</p>



<p>x264 is a flexible codec that lets you control many aspects of your recording. This means you can balance the video quality, file size, and recording time to meet your needs.</p>



<p>AV1 is a newer codec that can create high-quality videos with small file sizes. The downside is that it requires a lot of computing power, which can slow down your recording process.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, choosing a codec depends on what you need, what your computer can handle, and what kind of video you&#8217;re recording.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the realm of open-source video encoding, ffmpeg stands out as a versatile and powerful tool. Its capabilities range from simple video conversions to complex transcoding, filtering, and streaming tasks. Today, I&#8217;ll share some insights into optimizing ffmpeg for AV1 encoding using the Scalable Video Technology for AV1 (SVT-AV1) encoder.</p>



<p>AV1 is a high-efficiency video codec that improves over predecessors like VP9 and HEVC/H.265. It offers superior compression efficiency, reducing file sizes without sacrificing quality. However, AV1 encoding can be resource-intensive. SVT-AV1, an open-source project backed by Intel and Netflix, offers a performant encoder that can help balance efficiency with resource usage.</p>



<p>Here are the default ffmpeg settings I use for encoding videos with AV1 using the SVT-AV1 encoder:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background has-regular-font-size"><code lang="bash" class="language-bash">ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libsvtav1 -preset 5 -crf 28 -g 240 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -svtav1-params tune=0:film-grain=10 -c:a libopus -b:a 100k output.mkv</code></pre>



<p><strong>Video and Audio Settings</strong></p>



<p>The command includes a set of parameters tailored to optimize the encoding process:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>-c:v libsvtav1</strong>: This instructs ffmpeg to use the SVT-AV1 library for video encoding. SVT-AV1 is renowned for its efficient balance between encoding speed and video quality.</li>



<li><strong>-preset 5</strong>: A preset is a collection of options that will provide a certain encoding speed to compression ratio. A lower preset will provide better compression (smaller output file size) at the cost of encoding speed, while a higher preset will encode faster but with less compression. A preset of 5 is a good balance between encoding speed and compression ratio.</li>



<li><strong>-crf 28</strong>: The Constant Rate Factor (CRF) value influences the video quality during encoding. Lower values yield better quality but larger files, while higher values provide more compression but at the expense of quality. A CRF of 28 is a reasonable choice for maintaining good video quality while achieving satisfactory compression.</li>



<li><strong>-g 240</strong>: The <code>-g</code> option sets the group of pictures (GOP) size, which is the distance between keyframes. A keyframe is a frame where a complete image is stored in the data stream. In video compression, only changes that occur from one frame to the next are stored in the data stream, enabling significant data savings. A GOP size of 240 frames means a keyframe will be inserted at least every 240 frames. This balances between video quality, file size, and the ability to seek within the video.</li>



<li><strong>-pix_fmt yuv420p10le:</strong> This sets the pixel format to a widely recognized format, using 10 bits per color channel. This can slightly boost compression while preserving video quality. Sometimes, simply changing a video recording&#8217;s pixel format—especially from a rare camera pixel format to a more common one like yuv420p—can enhance compatibility.</li>



<li><strong>-svtav1-params tune=0:film-grain=10</strong>: Here, we pass direct parameters to the SVT-AV1 encoder. The <code>tune=0</code> parameter optimizes for visual quality. The <code>film-grain=10</code> parameter simulates film grain, which can potentially reduce file size by smoothing out noise during compression.</li>



<li><strong>-c:a libopus -b:a 100k</strong>: This command specifies the libopus codec for audio encoding at a bitrate of 100k. Despite the relatively low bitrate, libopus is capable of delivering clear and detailed sound, which makes it ideal for capturing even subtle audio nuances. It&#8217;s a free, future-proof, universally compatible codec favored by the open-source community for its robust performance and excellent quality-to-size ratio.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Output Format</strong></p>



<p>We choose MKV as our output format. While both MP4 and MKV support a wide variety of codecs, including AV1 and Opus, MKV has a few key advantages that make it more suitable for our use case. MKV is known for its robustness and flexibility, offering features such as error resilience, which is beneficial for maintaining video playback even if the file has minor corruptions. MKV also supports features like fast seeking and chapter markers, which can be useful for navigation within longer videos. Its open-source nature and wide support in the multimedia community further add to its appeal.</p>



<p>Remember, these settings are a starting point. The optimal parameters depend on your specific use case, input media, and hardware capabilities. However, these settings should provide a reasonable balance between quality, file size, and encoding time for a wide range of scenarios.</p>



<p><strong>Note on System Performance</strong></p>



<p>Encoding AV1, particularly with SVT-AV1, is a demanding process that can consume significant CPU resources. As a result, you may experience system slowdowns during the encoding process. If your system includes a dedicated graphics card that supports AV1 hardware encoding, you could reduce the CPU load by leveraging the power of your GPU.</p>



<p>So, if you have access to ffmpeg in the command line, give these settings a try. Experiment with different parameters, see what works best for your needs, and share your findings with the community. Happy encoding</p>

<p>In our digital age, many might find the notion of willingly running out of disk space a bit strange, if not downright absurd. Yet, that&#8217;s exactly the challenge I&#8217;ve willingly undertaken, a personal endeavour that blends technology, creativity, and perseverance in one exciting package.</p>



<p>4K resolution has undeniably revolutionized the world of video content. It promises a visual experience like no other, making every detail pop off the screen with stunning realism. However, the charm of 4K content comes at the cost of storage &#8211; these videos take up a substantial amount of space.</p>



<p>Now, imagine a world where your Network Attached Storage (NAS) and Solid State Drive (SSD) storage systems are teetering on the brink of saturation, filled to the brim with high-resolution 4K content. This is not a nightmare scenario for me; in fact, it&#8217;s the goal. The objective? To exhaust my disk space completely by creating and storing as much 4K content as possible.</p>



<p>But why, you might ask, would anyone set such a peculiar challenge? The answer lies in the thrill of pushing boundaries and exploring the landscape of digital possibilities. By deliberately setting constraints, we often unlock hidden creativity and innovation, pushing us to reimagine the norm. It is the daunting challenge of scarce storage that inspires me to continuously question and redefine my relationship with digital content and storage solutions.</p>



<p>This journey isn&#8217;t just about pushing my hardware to its limits; it&#8217;s also about how I handle the situation once I&#8217;ve reached that point. The real challenge begins once the storage is maxed out &#8211; how do I accommodate more 4K content? This task will compel me to explore new solutions and technology, develop innovative methods to optimize storage, and perhaps even venture into the realm of custom hardware or advanced compression algorithms.</p>



<p>The voyage of reaching and going beyond the digital saturation point through 4K recording may sound perplexing to some. Yet, it&#8217;s a journey that promises learning, creativity, and growth. It&#8217;s a testament to the fact that even in our seemingly limitless digital world, boundaries exist. But these boundaries aren&#8217;t roadblocks; they&#8217;re stepping stones to greater innovation and exploration.</p>



<p>So, as I embark on this challenge, I invite you to join me on this fascinating adventure. Brace yourself for the exciting twists and turns as we navigate the captivating world of 4K recording, limited storage, and the innovative solutions that emerge from it. Stay tuned to see how one runs out of disk space and what happens next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the grand garden party of our digital lives, our media files are like an assortment of guests. Photos are the charming social butterflies flitting around, documents are the articulate conversationalists, and music files are, well, the life of the party. But every now and then, there&#8217;s that uninvited houseguest &#8211; a 10GB video that was accidentally recorded, taking up space and causing a stir in our otherwise well-ordered party.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s set the scene &#8211; you&#8217;ve just come back from a summer trip, and you&#8217;re excited to relive the adventure through your photos and videos. But as you dive into your media library, there it is, a 10GB monstrosity, hogging space like an oversized beachball in your petite city apartment.</p>



<p>The surprise of finding such a large file is akin to discovering a bear has been hibernating in your backyard &#8211; shocking, mildly terrifying, and leaving you questioning, &#8220;How did this happen?&#8221;. Whether it was a pocket recording or a child&#8217;s filmmaking debut, these accidental guests often stay unnoticed until the storage space starts running thin.</p>



<p>But worry not! Just as with any uninvited guest, there are ways to handle this situation with grace and efficiency.</p>



<p>First, find the culprit. Tools that visualize storage can be handy assistants, presenting a map of your data usage and highlighting the storage-hogging files. Once you&#8217;ve discovered your uninvited guest, you have a few options.</p>



<p>If the file holds no value (like an hour-long recording of the inside of your pocket), bidding goodbye is easy &#8211; a click of the delete button, and you&#8217;ve regained your space. However, if the video is something meaningful – maybe your toddler&#8217;s first steps that unknowingly turned into a film-length epic – you might not want to part ways.</p>



<p>In that case, it&#8217;s time to consider compressing the video. Video compression tools can reduce the file size significantly while maintaining good quality. Think of it as transforming the uninvited houseguest into a more manageable, less space-consuming visitor.</p>



<p>Lastly, consider this an opportunity for a digital cleanup. Are there other forgotten, space-consuming files hiding in the corners of your media library? Could there be more uninvited guests waiting to be discovered? A summer cleaning of your digital space might just be the refreshment your devices need.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while stumbling upon an accidental 10GB video can initially feel like an unwelcome surprise, it&#8217;s an invitation to take control of your digital space. So this summer, embrace the adventure of maintaining your personal media library &#8211; because every grand garden party needs a good host. Remember, in the digital world, the power is in your hands, or should we say, your devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Maintaining control of your digital memories is more than just storing them securely; it&#8217;s also about ensuring their long-term survival. But when it comes to backing up these files, several questions arise: What files should I back up? How frequently should I do it? What about the new files I create?</p>



<p>Today, we aim to help you navigate the sea of these questions, giving you a sense of direction on your journey towards mastering your backup strategy.</p>



<p><strong>What Files Should I Back Up?</strong></p>



<p>Choosing what to back up primarily depends on how valuable and irreplaceable the files are. Personal photos, videos, and essential documents usually top the list. However, consider other data as well, such as your email files, application settings, and any work or school projects. When it comes to choosing what to backup, if in doubt, back it up. Storage is often cheaper than recreating lost files.</p>



<p><strong>How Frequently Should I Back Up?</strong></p>



<p>The frequency of your backups should reflect how often your data changes. For most individuals, a weekly or monthly backup might be sufficient. However, if you frequently add or alter files, you might want to opt for daily backups.</p>



<p>But remember, the aim is not to create an unmanageable abundance of backups, but to strike a balance between data security and resource management.</p>



<p><strong>What About The New Files?</strong></p>



<p>Managing new files can be tricky, especially if you&#8217;re continuously creating content. An effective way to address this is by incorporating incremental backups into your strategy.</p>



<p>Incremental backups only save the changes made since the last backup, which can be much quicker and require less storage than a full backup every time. This allows you to safeguard your new data without having to re-backup everything.</p>



<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p>



<p>Backup isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all scenario. It requires a personalized strategy that fits your unique data needs and habits. To ensure comprehensive protection, consider the 3-2-1 rule: Keep at least three copies of your data, store two on different media (like an external hard drive and a cloud backup), and keep one copy offsite to protect against physical damage at your primary location.</p>



<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>



<p>In the digital world, being proactive is crucial. Instead of waiting for a data loss event to realize the importance of backup, take action today. Remember, while every piece of data may not be critical, every piece is valuable. As you embark on this backup journey, hold fast to our motto &#8211; &#8216;Your memories, your control&#8217;. Because when it comes to your digital life, you&#8217;re the one in the driver&#8217;s seat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a world dominated by data, where we create, share, and store our precious moments digitally, control over our own memories has never been more important. In this post, we&#8217;re taking a look at how reclaiming control from cloud storage services like iCloud can redefine our relationship with our digital lives.</p>



<p><strong>The Power of Ownership</strong></p>



<p>The idea of &#8216;Your memories, your control&#8217; revolves around empowering individuals to take charge of their digital content. Whether it&#8217;s photos from your latest adventure, videos of your child&#8217;s first steps, or essential work documents, you should be the one who decides where and how they&#8217;re stored.</p>



<p><strong>Moving Away from the Cloud</strong></p>



<p>Cloud services like iCloud have offered a convenient solution to data storage for years. However, relying solely on these platforms comes with certain challenges. They include concerns over data privacy, potential data loss due to service outage, and the perpetual costs of increasing storage needs.</p>



<p><strong>A Liberating Change</strong></p>



<p>Embracing the concept of &#8216;Your memories, your control&#8217; implies seeking alternatives to iCloud and similar services. This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you have to give up the convenience of cloud storage entirely. Instead, it&#8217;s about finding or creating solutions that offer a blend of convenience, security, and most importantly, control.</p>



<p>There are many paths to take, from using encrypted cloud services that prioritize privacy, to setting up your own personal cloud or network-attached storage at home. The choice will depend on your specific needs and the level of control you desire.</p>



<p><strong>Embrace the Freedom</strong></p>



<p>Moving away from traditional cloud services might seem like a daunting step. However, it&#8217;s a journey towards increased autonomy and peace of mind. &#8216;Your memories, your control&#8217; is more than a slogan; it&#8217;s a commitment to the belief that our digital lives should be guided by our choices and not dictated by the constraints of a cloud service.</p>



<p>In conclusion, &#8216;Your memories, your control&#8217; isn&#8217;t a call to abandon technology. It&#8217;s a rallying cry for us to assert control over it, ensuring our precious memories and vital data remain exactly where they belong – in our hands.</p>
