# Contributing to Podanvil

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to Podanvil! We aim to make this process as straightforward and transparent as possible, whether you're:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Interested in becoming a maintainer

## Our Development Process Utilizes Github

We leverage Github for hosting our code, tracking issues and feature requests, and accepting pull requests.

## We Follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

We adopt the Github Flow model, meaning all code changes occur through pull requests. Pull requests are the preferred way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively encourage your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that requires testing, include the tests.
3. If you've altered APIs, update the corresponding documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Verify that your code adheres to our linting standards.
6. Issue your pull request!

## All Contributions Are Under the MIT Software License

In essence, when you submit code changes, your submissions are assumed to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. If you have any concerns about this, please don't hesitate to contact the maintainers.

## Use Github's [Issues](https://github.com/podanvil/podanvil/issues) to Report Bugs

We utilize GitHub issues to track public bugs. You can report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/podanvil/podanvil/issues); it's as simple as that!

## Write Detailed, Thorough Bug Reports

An effective bug report typically includes:

- A concise summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Be as specific as possible!
- Provide sample code if applicable.

**Thank You!**
