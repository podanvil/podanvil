<p>In today&#8217;s fast-moving world, website performance and security are critical. One interesting way to maximize these aspects is by serving your WordPress site as static files, updated daily, with a Rust server running on Kubernetes. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the benefits, challenges, and steps involved in this process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Static Files?</h2>



<p>Static websites offer several advantages. They load faster than dynamic sites because there&#8217;s no server-side processing, leading to better user experience and improved SEO. Static sites also have a smaller attack surface area, improving security. Furthermore, once generated, static sites are easy to serve and can be efficiently handled by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), making scalability easier to achieve.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Rust and Kubernetes?</h2>



<p>Rust is a modern system programming language that offers safety, concurrency, and performance. It&#8217;s an excellent choice for building a server thanks to its low resource usage and high speed. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust foundation for deploying our Rust server.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Generating Static Pages</h2>



<p>To turn our WordPress site into a static one, we can use a WordPress plugin like Simply Static, WP2Static, or Static HTML Output. These plugins generate a static version of your site, which can then be exported to a location where your Rust binary can access it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Serving Static Pages with Rust</h2>



<p>Our Rust application will be responsible for serving the static files. We can use the <code>warp</code> library for this purpose, creating a simple script to serve files in a specific directory.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dockerizing and Deploying with Kubernetes</h2>



<p>For deployment, we&#8217;ll use a distroless Docker image, which includes only our application and its runtime dependencies. Using a multi-stage Docker build, the first stage builds the Rust binary, and the second stage copies the Rust binary into a distroless base image.</p>



<p>We can then deploy this Docker image to Kubernetes, taking advantage of its powerful features for managing our server pods.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overcoming Limitations</h2>



<p>While static sites offer various benefits, they also come with some limitations. For example, updates on the WordPress site won&#8217;t immediately reflect on the live site until the next update cycle. Dynamic features such as user comments or e-commerce functionalities may be limited or require extra work to implement on static sites.</p>



<p>To handle e-commerce functionality, we can integrate third-party solutions like Snipcart, Shopify&#8217;s Buy Button, or Ecwid. For any other dynamic behavior, we can use serverless functions or API endpoints.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Serving your WordPress site as static files using a Rust server on Kubernetes can significantly improve your site&#8217;s performance and security. Although the setup might be complex, and there might be limitations to overcome, the benefits can make it a worthwhile approach for many WordPress site owners. Be sure to consider your specific needs and the trade-offs before deciding if this strategy is right for you.</p>
