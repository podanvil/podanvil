<p>Maintaining control of your digital memories is more than just storing them securely; it&#8217;s also about ensuring their long-term survival. But when it comes to backing up these files, several questions arise: What files should I back up? How frequently should I do it? What about the new files I create?</p>



<p>Today, we aim to help you navigate the sea of these questions, giving you a sense of direction on your journey towards mastering your backup strategy.</p>



<p><strong>What Files Should I Back Up?</strong></p>



<p>Choosing what to back up primarily depends on how valuable and irreplaceable the files are. Personal photos, videos, and essential documents usually top the list. However, consider other data as well, such as your email files, application settings, and any work or school projects. When it comes to choosing what to backup, if in doubt, back it up. Storage is often cheaper than recreating lost files.</p>



<p><strong>How Frequently Should I Back Up?</strong></p>



<p>The frequency of your backups should reflect how often your data changes. For most individuals, a weekly or monthly backup might be sufficient. However, if you frequently add or alter files, you might want to opt for daily backups.</p>



<p>But remember, the aim is not to create an unmanageable abundance of backups, but to strike a balance between data security and resource management.</p>



<p><strong>What About The New Files?</strong></p>



<p>Managing new files can be tricky, especially if you&#8217;re continuously creating content. An effective way to address this is by incorporating incremental backups into your strategy.</p>



<p>Incremental backups only save the changes made since the last backup, which can be much quicker and require less storage than a full backup every time. This allows you to safeguard your new data without having to re-backup everything.</p>



<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p>



<p>Backup isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all scenario. It requires a personalized strategy that fits your unique data needs and habits. To ensure comprehensive protection, consider the 3-2-1 rule: Keep at least three copies of your data, store two on different media (like an external hard drive and a cloud backup), and keep one copy offsite to protect against physical damage at your primary location.</p>



<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>



<p>In the digital world, being proactive is crucial. Instead of waiting for a data loss event to realize the importance of backup, take action today. Remember, while every piece of data may not be critical, every piece is valuable. As you embark on this backup journey, hold fast to our motto &#8211; &#8216;Your memories, your control&#8217;. Because when it comes to your digital life, you&#8217;re the one in the driver&#8217;s seat.</p>
